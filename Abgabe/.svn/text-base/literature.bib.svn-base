discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science
paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or
organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the
boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and
innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline,
positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology.
Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in
Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines
for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the designscience
paradigm knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its
solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact.
Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the
application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis o f the challenges
of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader
IS community},

Abstract = {Geographic place names are widely used but are semantically often highly ambiguous. For example, there are 491 places in Finland sharing the same name "Isosaari" (great island) that are instances of several geographical classes, such as Island, Forest, Peninsula, Inhabited area, etc. Referencing unambiguously to a particular "Isosaari", either when annotating content or during information retrieval, can be quite problematic and requires usage of advanced search methods and maps for semantic disambiguation. This paper presents an ontology server, ONKI-Paikka, for solving the place finding and place name disambiguation problem. In ONKI-Paikka, places can be found by a faceted search engine, combined with semantic autocompletion and a map service for constraining search and for visualizing results. The service can be connected to legacy applications cost-effectively by using Ajax-technology in the same spirit as Google Maps that is used in ONKI-Paikka as a subservice.},

  abstract =	"In this paper we present a reusable time ontology for
		 large-scale knowledge system applications, that is
		 intuitive, expressive, formally defined, logically
		 consistent, and ready-to-use. Our underlying time
		 theory treats both time points and time intervals as
		 primitive elements on a time line, and the ontology
		 contains a class hierarchy, relations, axioms and
		 instances built on those primitives. The main
		 contributions of this work are the following three. (1)
		 The ontology makes a distinction between closed and
		 open intervals, as opposed to many previous time
		 ontologies. However we provide flexibility of usage by
		 providing two sets of relations on intervals: one that
		 assumes that distinction and one that does not. (2)
		 Time granularity is implemented in the ontology to
		 facilitate representing time in varying granularity in
		 a layered model and switching from or relating one
		 granularity to a coarser/finer one. (3) The ontology
		 includes classes for calendar months, calendar days and
		 weekdays...",

  abstract = {Temporal knowledge representation and identification are crucial in many application areas, such as Semantic Web, knowledge sharing and reusing, and natural language processing. Building time ontologies has been viewed as a promising means to solve this task. However, practical time ontology is closely related with specific nations and cultures, though they may share a common part. In this paper, we present a Chinese time ontology for web services and knowledge systems which involve Chinese temporal entities and temporal properties. First we define a core component called the base time ontology. Upon this base time ontology, we build the other part of the Chinese time ontology, which includes temporal measurement and representation in Chinese specific ways, and transformation between temporal entities in the Chinese time ontology and the DAML time ontology. We argue that the base time ontology is not only a basic and integral part of the Chinese time ontology, but also a base for constructing other time ontologies as well.}

	The 13 papers presented in this book were all carefully reviewed before
	publication. They have been organized in three parts: Part I gives
	a general introduction to the idea and issues characterizing modularization
	and offers an in-depth analysis of properties, criteria and knowledge
	import techniques for modularization. Part II describes four major
	research proposals for creating modules from an existing ontology
	either by partitioning an ontology into a collection of modules or
	by extracting one or more modules from the ontology. Part III reports
	on collaborative approaches where modules that pre-exist are linked
	together through mappings to form a virtual large ontology.}

  abstract = {Defining a formal domain ontology is generally considered a useful,
	not to say necessary step in almost every software project. This
	is because software deals with ideas rather than with self-evident
	physical artefacts. However, this development step is hardly ever
	done, as ontologies rely on well-defined and semantically powerful
	AI concepts such as description logics or rule-based systems, and
	most software engineers are largely unfamiliar with these.
	
	
	Gasevic and his co-authors try to fill this gap by detailing how to
	use model-driven engineering for ontology development on the Semantic
	Web. Part I of their book describes existing technologies, tools,
	and standards like XML, RDF, OWL, MDA, and UML. Part II presents
	the first detailed description of OMG's new ODM (Ontology Definition
	Metamodel) initiative, a specification which is expected to be in
	the form of an OMG language like UML. Finally, Part III is dedicated
	to applications and practical aspects of developing ontologies using
	MDA-based languages.
	
	
	For this second edition, the descriptions of the related standards
	(like MOF, ODM, OCL, and OWL) have been revised and updated; new
	chapters introducing the basic principles of model-driven engineering,
	recent research results on metamodeling Semantic Web rule languages,
	an introduction to the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) and its
	tool support, and, last but not least, many new examples have been
	added.}

		 consistency checking of the concepts and relationships
		 in an agent-based model, can infer the assumptions
		 inherent in a model, can infer the assumptions and the
		 parameters inherent in a simulation or software
		 representation of a model, and can enforce adherence to
